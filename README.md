# Startup Data Visualization

This repository contains the codebase for the Startup Data Visualization project, developed as a course project for COMP2030 Software Construction at Vin University. The project aims to streamline startup data management through a web-based platform with real-time tracking, visualization, and reporting capabilities.

## Structure

The project is divided into two main repositories:
- **Backend**: Contains the Django-based backend with REST API integration. Please find setup instructions in `backend/README.md`.
- **Frontend**: Contains the Next.js and Tailwind CSS-based frontend. Refer to the frontend repository: [Autopilot7/Startup-visualization](https://github.com/Autopilot7/Startup-visualization).

For detailed setup and deployment instructions for the backend, please refer to `backend/README.md`.
